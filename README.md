INTRODUCTION:  
Cloud-based online educational systems have revolutionized the way we learn and teach. These systems offer 
a flexible, accessible, and scalable platform for delivering high-quality education. Students can access course 
materials, participate in discussions, and complete assignments from anywhere with an internet connection, 
breaking down geographical barriers.    
For instructors, cloud-based platforms provide a wealth of tools to enhance their teaching. They can create 
interactive lectures, virtual labs, and online assessments. Additionally, these systems can track student 
engagement and performance, providing valuable insights for tailoring instruction. 
With cloud-based platforms, educational institutions can adapt to changing educational needs and deliver a 
more personalized and effective learning experience.
